# DevExpress Blazor CSS Upgrade Complete ✅

## Issue Resolved
Successfully updated the application to use the new DevExpress.Blazor.Themes NuGet package as required by the latest DevExpress Blazor version.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added DevExpress.Blazor.Themes Package
```bash
dotnet add package DevExpress.Blazor.Themes
```

### 2. Updated CSS References in App.razor
**Removed outdated references:**
```html
<!-- OLD - Deprecated -->
<link href="_content/DevExpress.Blazor/dx-blazor.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="_content/DevExpress.Blazor/dx-blazor-icons.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

**Added new Bootstrap 5 external theme:**
```html
<!-- NEW - Updated for Bootstrap 5 -->
<link href="_content/DevExpress.Blazor.Themes/bootstrap-external.bs5.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### 3. Program.cs Configuration
Kept the DevExpress Blazor service configuration clean:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddDevExpressBlazor(configure => {
    configure.SizeMode = DevExpress.Blazor.SizeMode.Medium;
});
```

Note: The `BootstrapVersion` property is obsolete in newer versions and was removed.

## Bootstrap Version Detected
- **Bootstrap Version**: 5.3.3 (detected from wwwroot/lib/bootstrap)
- **Theme Used**: bootstrap-external.bs5.min.css (for external Bootstrap themes)

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Resolves "outdated DevExpress Blazor CSS resources" warning
- ✅ Ensures proper icon display with current DevExpress version
- ✅ Maintains Bootstrap 5 compatibility
- ✅ Future-proofs the application for DevExpress updates

## Application Status
The application should now start without CSS resource warnings and display DevExpress icons correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Start the application: `dotnet run`
2. Navigate to https://localhost:5001
3. Test the Employee Management interface
4. Verify icons display correctly in the grid and buttons
